# binge-list

A web application for movie enthusiasts who want to save movies to a list so that they can refer to it later.

As a movie enthusiast myself, I noticed I would browse through multiple applications and save movies I'd want to watch later onto my notes application on my app. This inspired me to make an application that allows searching for movies and saving it on to their watchlist convenient.

## Live Demo

Try the application live at https://seankim248.github.io/binge-list/

## Technologies Used

 - Vanilla JS
 - XMLHttpRequest
 - TMDB API

## Features

 - User can view a list of movies by their poster img and title
 - User can view description of each movie
 - User can filter movies by genres

## Stretch features I'd like to implement
